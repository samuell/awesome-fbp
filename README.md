## FBP Libraries and frameworks

### Graphical FBP network editors

- [DrawFBP](https://github.com/jpaulm/drawfbp) - Java based simple FBP editor created by FBP inventor
- [FlowHub](https://flowhub.io/) - Web based interface particularly for NoFlo (see below), but also supports a generic FBP network protocol
- [Slang](https://tryslang.com/) - Short for stream language, offering purely visual programming without the need of preprogrammed components
